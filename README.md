# PixelDatabase.Net.Paint.Net
This is an attempt to provide text based image editing to Paint.Net, just like my site PixelDatabase.Net.

This is not even ready to be tested yet, so do not attempt to install this into Paint.Net as it just crashed on me and I have to uninstall paint.net and reinstall.

I never liked Plug-ins, I may stick with Blazor.

PixelDatabase.Net and Paint.Net are cousins, although Paint.Net hasn't been given the DNA results yet. Watch for the Jerry Springer episode.

My website https://pixeldatabase.net is powered by a Nuget package DataJuggler.PixelDatabase for .Net Core.

This Plug-In uses a port of that for .Net Framework DataJuggler.PixelDatabase.Net

First version is going to use the standard UI. Second version I will build a user control.

The help for this project is available: https://pixeldatabase.net/help

More to come.
