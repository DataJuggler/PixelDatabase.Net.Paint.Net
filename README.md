# PixelDatabase.Net.Paint.Net
This is an attempt to provide text based image editing to Paint.Net, just like my site PixelDatabase.Net.

PixelDatabase.Net and Paint.Net are cousins, although Paint.Net hasn't been given the DNA results yet. Watch for the Jerry Springer episode.

My website https://pixeldatabase.net is powered by a Nuget package DataJuggler.PixelDatabase for .Net Core.

This Plug-In uses a port of that for .Net Framework DataJuggler.PixelDatabase.Net

First version is going to use the standard UI. Second version I will build a user control.

The help for this project is available: https://pixeldatabase.net/help

More to come.
